# Death-rate-by-country-and-its-cause
​ The dataset covers residents across 204 countries. It is a comprehensive dataset of the death rates of all countries and their causes. 
 The variable covers a broad spectrum of causes of mortality globally.​

Data Collection :​
Ownership of this dataset is a dataset sourced from the web 'Kaggle'​
Licence: CC0 1.0​
Data Collection spans from 1990-2019, contains 31 variables and 2610 columns​
​
Data Limitation:​
The data set lacks age groups, gender, unemployment rate, education levels, and poverty rates​
There may be missing values for certain countries or specific causes of death.​
The dataset might not cover all countries or all significant causes of death.​
Potential inconsistencies in data reporting standards and definitions of causes of death across countries.​
The dataset may not be updated in real time, leading to a time lag between data collection and availability.​

⚠️ Data Limitations
Missing Demographics:

Age groups, gender, unemployment rates, education levels, and poverty rates are not included.
Data Completeness:

Missing values for certain countries or specific causes of death.
Coverage Limitations:

The dataset may not include all countries or significant causes of death.
Reporting Inconsistencies:

Differences in reporting standards and definitions of causes of death across countries.
Time Lag:

Data may not be updated in real-time, leading to potential delays between collection and availability.
🔍 Key Findings
Leading Causes of Death:

High Systolic Blood Pressure remains the leading cause of mortality, with 888,664 deaths recorded.
Top 5 Causes:

Smoking: 567,322 deaths
High Fasting Plasma Glucose: 524,647 deaths
Air Pollution: 502,501 deaths
High Body Mass Index: 456,565 deaths
Trends Over Time:

High Systolic Blood Pressure shows a general decrease.
Smoking exhibits a relatively stable trend with slight fluctuations.
Air Pollution trends decline over time, but with notable fluctuations.
High Body Mass Index has gradually increased.
Regional Patterns:

Developed Countries: Higher mortality rates from non-communicable diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer).
Developing Countries: Higher mortality rates from communicable diseases and nutritional deficiencies.
